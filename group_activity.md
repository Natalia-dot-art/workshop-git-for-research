Each group will attempt to complete the challenge (outlined below) using Git and Github.

This repo is public, but only Tyler (the owner) can contribute to it directly.

# Fork

First, one member from each group should fork the repo. (See [these docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) for more info.)

# Clone

Then, each group member should clone their respective group's forked repo. (See [text](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo#cloning-your-forked-repository)).

Do not worry about configuring your forked repo to stay in sync with my original (upstream) repo.

# Do science

In your group's repo, you will need to:
* unscramble the provided data
* analyze the unscrambled data (and include this analysis file in your repo)
* include your answers to the important questions in your repoz

DO NOT push the unscrambled data to Github. This is highly sensitive, and by doing so you may incur the wrath of your biggest academic heroes. However, you also may not delete this file from your repo.

# Pull request

Open pull request back to original (upstream) repo.
